<p>The competition aimed at creating an urban planning concept to develop an area around St. Nedelya Church. The goal of my team was to design a multifunctional, comfortable environment, and emphasise the sight's identity.</p>
<p>Under the St. Nedelya square, there are ruins of the ancient town of Serdica. Given today's urban planning situation, there was no opportunity for archaeological excavations to happen and let the general public explore the ruins.</p>
<p>After some research, I suggested we base our project on virtual reality. I developed a concept of using augmented reality on smartphones, which would be available for all visitors as well as make it possible to scan the environment and discover the layered cultural heritage. I also included in the project a virtual reality pavilion, which was supposed to become a platform for training courses devoted to the history of Bulgaria and be open to everyone interested.</p>
<p>The project won second place among participants from all over the world. The Jury appreciated our decision to connect physical and augmented reality.</p>
